# Utils

Abstractions and helper classes. Usually decently documented and (hopefully) trivial to use.

* `graphics` - OpenGL abstractions to make drawing easier
* `opencv` - OpenCV and Realsense snippets to make accessing cameras and image processing easier
* `paths` - Tank drive calculation
* `sockets` - TCP socket abstractions
* `splines` - Spline calculation
* `vectors` - Small vector class to facilitate calculations
